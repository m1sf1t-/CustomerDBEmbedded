Currently working on the create, read, update, and delete features within the GUI.

Back end database classes all seem to work fine. No known bugs. Will do more testing.

Need to learn how to do unit testing, thinking on that...

All input is more than welcome!

I am using the Eclipse Indigo IDE to maintain this code.
 
It'd probably be easiest for anyone if they imported the project using that program, but
that is just my recommendation.

I will also do regular builds, named "build_DD_MM_YYYY.jar" within the builds/ folder.

All builds will be a runnable JAR file. To run the JAR file, you need the Java Runtime Environment.
In Windows, you should be able to double click the JAR file and it will just run. In linux, do "java -jar build_DD_MM_YYYY.jar"

The JAR will create a folder containing the Apache Derby database in the directory in which you run the file.

If you would like the program to use the sample database, download builds/CustomerDatabase, and run the JAR 
file in the directory that CustomerDatabase/ is located.
